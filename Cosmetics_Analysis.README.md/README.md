### Project Description 


### About the Data


### Process


### Findings
•	There are 1,472 products among 117 brands that are applicable to a variety of skin type combinations  

•	The average price range for cosmetics products is $184 - $10. We explored the High end priced and low end price brands to determine which is better. 

•	We found 61 products among 8 brands that are applicable to all skin types. 

•	We found that both high and low end brands have approxiamtely the same ranking. However, we found more products applicable to all skin types on the high end of pricing. 


### Reflection
I have a solid history using Excel/ Google Sheets in the workplace. My key takeaway from this project involved data organization, documentation, and presentation. This was a huge data set with multiple columns and rows, so taking the time to document each data preparation step was paramount. It was also critical to lock certain sheets containing raw data to prevent errors and check work. Lastly, creating a table of contents that linked each sheet to a title allowed me to stay organized and it makes the workbook look professional.
